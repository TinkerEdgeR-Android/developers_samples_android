            Sample demonstrates best practices for Notification Styles that support Android
            phone/tablets and Android Wear. The phone app demonstrates best practices if you do not
            have a dedicated Android Wear app for Notifications. While the Android Wear app
            demonstrates best practices for a standalone Wear Notification experience without
            the Notifications showing on the phone/tablet.

             (e.g. "Hello World", activities, intents)

             Intermediate is for content that covers material a beginner doesn't need
             to know, but that a skilled developer is expected to know.
             (e.g. services, basic styles and theming, sync adapters)

             Advanced is for highly technical content geared towards experienced developers.
             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->
